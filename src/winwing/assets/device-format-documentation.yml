# Proposed device configuration file
#
# A device or the simulator sends a report (name loosely inspired by HID protocol).
# Reports have a "type", and depending on their type, carry information or value they transfer.
# That's what this file attempts to show.
#
# Device reports are sent by HID device. They carry some information. For example, a "key-pressed"
# report is issued when a key is pressed, and the information it carries it the name or identifier
# of the key that was pressed.
# This file explain what must be done when that report is received: the action that must be carried over.
#
# Similarly, the simulator also sends messages on the Web socket, reflecting simulator variable changes,
# or executed commands.
# In turn, these simulator-reports trigger actions on the device: refresh the display (set-display),
# turn this LED on or off, adjust screen brightness or keyboard backlight...
